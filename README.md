# speech-to-text

Real-time transcription using [faster-whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper)

![architecture](docs/architecture.png)

Accepts audio input from a microphone using a [Sounddevice](https://github.com/spatialaudio/python-sounddevice). By using [Silero VAD](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad)(Voice Activity Detection), silent parts are detected and recognized as one voice data. This audio data is converted to text using Faster-Whisper.

The HTML-based GUI allows you to check the transcription results and make detailed settings for the faster-whisper.

## Transcription speed

If the sentences are well separated, the transcription takes less than a second.
